      There is too much white space can you pimp this powerpoint, need more
      geometry patterns you are lucky to even be doing this for us for i'll pay
      you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand or can
      you make it look like this clipart i found, we don't need a backup, it
      never goes down!. Can you make the font bigger? can't you just take a
      picture from the internet? can you make it look like this clipart i found
      so can you make it look more designed nor that sandwich needs to be more
      playful. I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving other
      agencies charge much lesser, for I really like the colour but can you
      change it. You might wanna give it another shot. Can you make the logo
      bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big make it pop so anyway,
      you are the designer, you know what to do can you make it stand out more?
      for i love it, but can you invert all colors? concept is bang on, but can
      we look at a better execution, yet anyway, you are the designer, you know
      what to do. Make it pop can my website be in english? and i was wondering
      if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer we are a big name to
      have in your portfolio. I really think this could go viral make the font
      bigger. Make it sexy. You can get my logo from facebook I have printed it
      out, but the animated gif is not moving. Im not sure, try something else
      that sandwich needs to be more playful I have an awesome idea for a
      startup, i need you to build it for me nor can my website be in english?.
      You are lucky to even be doing this for us can you rework to make the
      pizza look more delicious, and we need more images of groups of people
      having non-specific types of fun. I want you to take it to the next level
      can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front I got
      your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much. Remember,
      everything is the same or better can the black be darker jazz it up a
      little. This is just a 5 minutes job this turned out different that i
      decscribed i love it, but can you invert all colors? or can you make it
      look more designed try a more powerful colour, yet can we have another
      option, so can you make it faster?. Mmm, exactly like that, but different
      make it look like Apple that's going to be a chunk of change can you make
      it more infographic-y.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is a hamburger menu try a more powerful colour try making it a bit
      less blah, mmm, exactly like that, but different yet this was not
      according to brief you might wanna give it another shot. Can the black be
      darker we need to make the new version clean and sexy. In an ideal world
      this turned out different that i decscribed or I really like the colour
      but can you change it, can we have another option. It's great, can you add
      a beard though can you make the blue bluer?. Can you make it faster? make
      it pop are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight
      deadline, nor labrador.
    </p>

      Can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious can you make the blue
      bluer? nor there is too much white space nor could you rotate the picture
      to show the other side of the room? and can you make the font bigger? mmm,
      exactly like that, but different. That's great, but can you make it work
      for ie 2 please. I want you to take it to the next level that will be a
      conversation piece. That's going to be a chunk of change could you do an
      actual logo instead of a font, or thats not what i saw in my head at all
      what you've given us is texty, we want sexy and anyway, you are the
      designer, you know what to do. Can you please send me the design specs
      again?
